                Every semester, we host industry professionals who share their
                experiences and insights, providing a unique learning
                opportunity for all attendees. Open to everyone, these sessions
                allow students to engage directly with experts, posing questions
                and gaining a clearer understanding of what a career in the
                industry entails. In previous sessions, we have welcomed
                speakers from prominent companies such as Meta, Amazon,
                MunichRE, and Hilton, among others.

                During the semester, our focus includes extensive reading of
                machine learning and data science papers, enhancing our
                understanding and ability to articulate complex concepts. To aid
                in comprehension and to assist others, we frequently craft
                summaries and analyses of these papers. Additionally, we
                occasionally author blog posts detailing our projects, further
                contributing to our learning and sharing community.
